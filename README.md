# Tribute-Webpage
## About:
Welcome to my tribute webpage dedicated to Rabindranath Tagore, a Bengali poet, philosopher, and polymath who reshaped Bengali literature and music in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. I chose to make this tribute webpage on Tagore because I am deeply moved by his poetry and philosophy, which convey a profound understanding of human nature and the human condition. Through this webpage, I hope to share Tagore's message of love, spirituality, and social justice, and inspire others to discover the beauty and depth of his works.
